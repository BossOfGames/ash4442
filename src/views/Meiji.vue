            <h1>Revolution & Empire</h1>
            <p>
               The Tokugawa regime, after the introduction
            </p>
            <h2>The Transition</h2>
            <p>The first thing completed to completely alter the political order. The daimyo domains became politically
                powerful over its 260-year existence. So, the Meiji leaders crafted careful tactics to abolish all the
                daimyo domains. These included voluntary surrendering lands to the emperor, solidifying that that all
                land is owned by him. To keep the key daimyos happy, they were “guaranteed respect and a voice in the
                new order if they wished. In fact, they were all quickly reappointed as domain governors with handsome
                salaries.”
            </p>
            <p>
                As soon all the political opponents were paid off and other domains taken care of, Emperor Meiji
                announced that all the daimyos were abolished and the “prefecture” system would be instated.
            </p>
            <h2>Japanese Societal Structure (REVISED)</h2>
            <p>
                Eliminating the existing status system was a important achievement. The existing Tokugawa social classes
                were completely uprooted. In its place, the Meiji government established the commoner. However, not everyone was considered a commoner.

            <p>
                However, if one didn’t fit within the four class structures, they were considered outcasts.
                These outcasts were delegated work that was considered lower from society, like burials, executions, and
                the handling of animal carcasses. (Gordon, p.18)
